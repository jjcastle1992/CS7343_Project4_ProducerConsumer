Running Project 4 (The Producer-Consumer Problem):

This exercise has been setup to ask you to provide three inputs per spec:

1) Number of seconds to put the main thread to sleep (i.e. how long the producers and consumers) should run before the 
app terminates). Please use an unsigned int.
2) Number of producers threads to create (please use an unsigned int)
3) Number of consumer threads to create (please use an unsigned int)

The App will then run for the specified time, outputting actions of producers and consumers as it relates to the buffer

At the end of the application run, the final buffer state will display.
